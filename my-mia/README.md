# DEPRECATED

The Steroids Kitchensink app has been deprecated in favor of the Supersonic Kitchensink app at https://github.com/AppGyver/supersonic-kitchensink

This repository is preserved only for legacy purposes: the app uses an outdated version of Steroids and does not fully demonstrate the capabilities of Supersonic/Steroids.

## AppGyver Steroids Kitchensink

This work-in-progress project demonstrates the functionalities of the [Steroids.js](http://www.appgyver.com/steroids) hybrid app development platform.
